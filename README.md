# Patient-Room-Monitoring-System
One of the major issues to decreasing healthcare infrastructure is the un monitored use and optimization of resources. There is a big loophole and in majority of cases lack of proper healthcare facilities to tackle the rising need by the patients. In such a scenario with increasing number of patients there is a load on the healthcare system and it burdens the infrastructure leading to unmonitored resources. In such cases there is a urging need for a proper monitoring system to avoid any hasty incidents.
This project provides a combination of process of sensing several gas levels in the air and also the ambient temperature and humidity along with light intensity, thus sensing the quality of the air and intensity of light. The levels of the gases and the temperature is displayed on the Blynk panel which continuously shows the real time output values of the gas sensors, temperature and humidity sensor and LDR sensor.
